# rick-and-morty-app

Hi! 

This app displays a list of rick and morty characters by consuming the official api from https://rickandmortyapi.com
Here, you can filter your search by name and sort by status (Alive, Dead or unknow), and navigate through the pagination.

To run the project, you just need to fallow the basics steps of the setup :)
